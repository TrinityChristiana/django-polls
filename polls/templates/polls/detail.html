        {% comment %} We set the form’s action to {% url 'polls:vote' question.id %}, and we set method="post". Using method="post" (as opposed to method="get") is very important, because the act of submitting this form will alter data server-side. Whenever you create a form that alters data server-side, use method="post". This tip isn’t specific to Django; it’s good Web development practice in general. {% endcomment %}
        <form action="{% url 'polls:vote' question.id %}" method="post">
        
        {% comment %} Since we’re creating a POST form (which can have the effect of modifying data), we need to worry about Cross Site Request Forgeries. Thankfully, you don’t have to worry too hard, because Django comes with a helpful system for protecting against it. In short, all POST forms that are targeted at internal URLs should use the {% csrf_token %} template tag. {% endcomment %}
        {% csrf_token %}
        {% for choice in question.choice_set.all %}

            {% comment %} There's a radio button for each question choice. The value of each radio button is the associated question choice’s ID. The name of each radio button is "choice". That means, when somebody selects one of the radio buttons and submits the form, it’ll send the POST data choice=# where # is the ID of the selected choice. This is the basic concept of HTML forms. {% endcomment %}
            <input type="radio" name="choice" id="choice{{ forloop.counter }}" value="{{ choice.id }}">

            {% comment %} forloop.counter indicates how many times the for tag has gone through its loop {% endcomment %}
            <label for="choice{{ forloop.counter }}">{{ choice.choice_text }}</label><br>
        {% endfor %}
        <input type="submit" value="Vote">
